## 99 Bottles of Beer in GNU Make Script

This Makefile prints out the lyrics of the song "99 Bottles of Beer"
using the script facilities of the GNU "make" utility.

It is a solution to a programming task on RosettaCode.org:  
  http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer

Run "make" without any parameters to generate the lyrics.  
Run "make N-bottles" or "make N" to start with a different number of bottles.  
Run "make check" to automatically validate the program output.
